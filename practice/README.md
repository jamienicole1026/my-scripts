# Practice Scripts

Experimental code, learning projects, and practice exercises.

## Purpose

This folder is for:
- Learning new languages or tools
- Testing ideas before making them "production"
- Code experiments and prototypes
- Tutorial follow-alongs
- Proof-of-concept scripts

## Organization

You can organize however you like:
- By language (python/, javascript/, bash/)
- By topic (api-testing/, web-scraping-experiments/)
- By date (2025-01/, 2025-02/)
- Just throw everything in here!

## No Pressure

Unlike other folders, scripts here don't need to be:
- Fully documented
- Production-ready
- Perfect or polished

This is your sandbox! 🏖️

## Graduation Path

When a practice script becomes useful:
1. Clean it up and add documentation
2. Move it to the appropriate folder (web/, files/, etc.)
3. Update the main README
